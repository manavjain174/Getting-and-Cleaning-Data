# Tidy data set description
## The variables in the tidy data
Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

## Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
## The data were averaged based on subject and activity group.
Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

## The tidy data contains 6 rows (averaged based on activity) and 68 columns (66 variables and activity labels).
